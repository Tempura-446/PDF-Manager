# Changelog

What changed in each version of ZPDF. The newest is first; each section is
also the notes of its release on
[ZPDF-releases](https://github.com/Tempura-446/ZPDF-releases/releases).

## 0.16.0

- When something goes wrong, the message carries a short error ID, and
  ZPDF keeps a log of what happened (the tools run, how long they took, and
  errors), with document names and your user folder left out. Settings ›
  About › Copy diagnostics copies the details needed to report a problem;
  Open log folder shows the log.
- Damaged and unusual PDFs (cut short, broken cross-references, looping
  page trees, bad pictures and fonts, no pages, empty or oddly rotated
  pages) now get a plain message from every tool instead of an unexpected
  error, and messages name your file rather than ZPDF's working folder.
  Every tool is tested on a set of such files.
- Security: converting Word, Excel and PowerPoint files never runs their
  macros; a saved web page can't pull other files from your PC into the
  PDF it's printed to; Ghostscript runs in its safe mode; the file catalog
  can't turn a document title into a spreadsheet formula; Settings only
  accepts ZPDF's own update repositories; Windows programs are started by
  their full path.
- Performance limits: checks that memory follows a file's size, not its
  page count, for merging, compressing and OCR, and that a 200 MB file
  reaches the reader in pieces. They run when a version is released.
- PDF → Word with "Best available": if Microsoft Word fails or doesn't
  finish (on some PCs it never does when another program drives it), ZPDF's
  own converter is used instead and the result says so, rather than a wait
  of five minutes and an error. A Word that doesn't answer is closed, not
  left running out of sight.
- Web page → PDF no longer fails when Edge hands the printing to a browser
  process of its own and that one finishes a moment later.

## 0.15.1

- Updating or installing on a PC whose newest Python is one the built-in OCR
  engine has no version for yet (Python 3.15 when it came out) failed. The
  installer now picks Python 3.10 to 3.14, installing Python 3.13 for ZPDF
  if there's none, and moves an existing ZPDF onto it. If the OCR engine
  still can't be installed, ZPDF is installed or updated without it and
  says so, rather than not at all.
- Publishing a release checks first that GitHub's gh is installed and
  signed in and that git has a name and email for the version tag, and says
  plainly if the release went out but its tag didn't.

## 0.15.0

- Releases for friends: each version is published on ZPDF-releases as one
  zip with the installer, its SHA-256 beside it. No GitHub account is needed
  to download or to update.
- The Update button follows those releases and checks the download's
  checksum before installing it. No token to set up any more (a development
  copy can still follow the private repository with one).
- Licence: ZPDF is shared under the PolyForm Internal Use License 1.0.0,
  with personal use added: use it at home or at work and change it for your
  own use, but don't pass it on. It comes as is, without warranty.
- Settings has an About section with the licence and the notices of the
  software by others that ZPDF includes or installs.
- `packaging/release.py` checks a version (the tests, the app build and its
  self-test), makes the release files and publishes them.

## 0.14.0

- OCR is built in: PaddleOCR's PP-OCR models, run with ONNX Runtime, read
  scans with nothing else to install. On a hard set of test scans the mean
  character error rate is 0.3 %, against 35.6 % for Tesseract with its
  English data.
- Sideways and upside-down pages are turned upright, two-column pages are
  read column by column, and table rows stay together.
- Russian, other Cyrillic, Korean, Arabic, Persian, Hindi, Thai, Greek,
  Tamil and Telugu: the reading model for the script is fetched once and
  checked against its published checksum.
- The text layer works in every reader and keeps files fit for PDF/A.
- Clean up scans can turn pages upright without Tesseract.
- Tesseract stays as a second engine; the installer offers it and
  Ghostscript as extras.

## 0.13.0

- True redaction: what's under the boxes is removed, the rest of the page
  stays text. Also on scanned pages with OCR text.
- Accessibility: tag PDFs for screen readers and check them, like Acrobat's
  accessibility check.
- PDF to PowerPoint and PDF to HTML, with tables, lists and columns.
- Password permissions, attached files, page labels, repair and fast web view.
- Stamps in the reader, a comment summary, FDF and XFDF export and import,
  and web page to PDF.
- Form formats, totals and checks, with form scripts running in the reader.
- Text editing flows within its paragraph, with a font picker.

## 0.12.0

- Make a printed form fillable: ZPDF finds its fields by itself.
- Radio buttons, dropdowns and list boxes.
- PDF/A check.

## 0.11.0

- Edit pictures and links in the reader.
- Sign with a digital ID and check signatures.
- PDF to Excel.

## 0.10.0

- Measuring: rectangles, cut-outs, counts and angles, with names, groups
  and colours, kept with the file, as CSV, or saved into the PDF.
- Compare drawing revisions in the reader.

## 0.9.0

- Save in place (Ctrl+S) and Save as in the file's folder; big files open
  in pieces.
- Notes, comments, underline, strikeout and shapes in the reader.
- Page tools: blank pages, split at bookmarks or by size, booklets, trim
  white margins.
- Drawing scales stored in the PDF are read.

## 0.8.0 and earlier

- 0.8: measuring with path lengths, a list with totals and units, undo and
  redo; safer reading of broken files.
- 0.7: live previews, favourite tools and clearer tool pages.
- 0.6: drawing scales, true paper size, a measure tool that snaps to the
  drawing's lines, and text edits that stay in place.
- 0.5 and before: the tools, the reader, the desktop app and the Windows
  installer.
